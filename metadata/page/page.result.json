If your situation gets worse or you’re concerned, you should seek legal advice. \r\n \r\n##Do it now – check if your health issue is due to the disrepair\r\n\r\nYou’ll need evidence from your doctor to take further action. Make sure you get a doctor’s note as evidence if your health is affected. \r\n\r\n##Do it now – contact your landlord \r\n\r\nContact your landlord to make sure they’re aware of the problem. Do it in writing, by email or in a letter so you have a record. \r\n\r\nWhen you write to them: \r\n \r\n* explain the work that needs to be carried out\r\n* remind them of their responsibility to carry out repairs \r\n* suggest dates and times for the repairs\r\n \r\nGive your landlord a reasonable deadline to respond and follow up if they do not. Try to be as flexible as you can and agree on the repairs to be carried out. If you rent from a letting agent you can make a complaint about them if they don’t pass on your repair requests to the landlord. \r\n\r\n##Do it later – contact your local council \r\n\r\nIf your landlord fails to have repairs carried out, you can ask for the environmental health department of your local authority to inspect your home. \r\n\r\nIf you’re having trouble getting the council to carry out an inspection, find your local council and ask your local councillor to contact the private renting team on your behalf. \r\n\r\nReporting your landlord to the council may encourage them to do the work but if you’re an assured shorthold tenant it could give them the right to evict you. \r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n##Responsibilities\r\n\r\n###You’re responsible for:\r\n\r\n* ventilating and heating your home so damp doesn't build up \r\n* fixing your own appliances or furniture\r\n* repairing damage caused by you, your family or your guests \r\n* carrying out minor repairs set out in your tenancy agreement \r\n* reporting repairs to your landlord as soon as possible \r\n* allowing access to your home at reasonable times \r\n\r\n###Your landlord is responsible for: \r\n\r\n* making sure your home is safe and free from hazards \r\n* fixing damp or mould caused by a repair problem \r\n* fixing damp or mould that affects your health\r\n* keeping the exterior and structure of your home in good condition \r\n* maintaining basins, sinks, baths, toilets and pipework \r\n* repairs where a design problem causes damage to the building, for example to a wall or ceiling plaster \r\n* repairs needed to stop pests getting into your home \r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n##Risks to know about \r\n\r\n###What if the council doesn’t address my complaint? \r\n\r\nYou can complain to the Ombudsman. They can only accept your complaint once you pass the council’s deadline for dealing with the complaint or the final outcome. \r\n\r\n###What if I did not keep written evidence or photos?\r\n\r\nIt’s important to double check for any written evidence you may have with your council or housing association about the issue, or your attempts to organise repairs. \r\n\r\nIf you do not have evidence, you should still follow the advice above, but keep a record from now on. If you discuss the issue in person or over the phone in future, follow it up in writing and keep a copy of your letter or email. Make sure to record: \r\n\r\n* the date you spoke to them \r\n* anything they agreed to do \r\n\r\nContact your local council if your landlord: \r\n\r\n* doesn’t deal with the problem \r\n* is slow to do the work \r\n* carried out an inspection but has done little or nothing since \r\n* carries out the repair work but to a poor standard \r\n\r\nFind the right department to complain and make sure you follow existing guidance to complain in writing. \r\n\r\n* I didn’t pay rent due to debts \r\n* I moved out because my landlord wasn’t helpful \r\n\r\n[Back to next actions](/next-actions)\r\n",
